# What is PrompScript?

An open source **prompting language** to prompt better and easier.

# Why we need this?

Too many prompts everywhere and everything is so complicated. 
Hard to write, hard to remember, hard to template.
Plus, Old way prompting wastes too many words (a.k.a tokens!)

## Example Prompt (old way)

I want you to act as a screenwriter. You will develop an engaging and creative script for either a feature length film, or a Web Series that can captivate its viewers. Start with coming up with interesting characters, the setting of the story, dialogues between the characters etc. Once your character development is complete - create an exciting storyline filled with twists and turns that keeps the viewers in suspense until the end. 

## With PromptScript (new way)
write: script
for: film
start with: interesting characters
include: dialogues, storyline filled with twists
keep: the viewers in suspense until the end
